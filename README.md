## What I Learned
- A VPN encrypts your traffic and hides your real IP.
- It enhances privacy on public Wi-Fi.
- VPNs use tunneling protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard.
- VPNs can slightly reduce browsing speed due to encryption overhead.
- While VPNs improve privacy, they donâ€™t guarantee complete anonymity.
